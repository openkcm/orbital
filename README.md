## About this project

Orbital is an open-source framework crafted to synchronize resources seamlessly across system boundaries. Achieving eventual consistency, it offers real-time introspection to report resource states with ease. Simplifying resource management, it requires consumers to implement only a single functional operator, eliminating the need for on-site databases or meta state storage.

## Requirements and Setup

Orbital is a library to reconcile state across service boundaries.
